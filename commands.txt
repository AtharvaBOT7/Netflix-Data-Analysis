You will need to create a new directory inside your project directory named dbt to start the project.
--> mkdir ~/.dbt

The next step is to initialise dbt inside the virtual environment.
--> dbt init netflixproject

Upon executing this step, you will be prompted to enter a number respective to the database you are using, in our case, we will use 
the snowflake database.

Then you will be asked to enter the account number, password, warehouse name, database name and schema name, which you can find in 
snowflake connect to an external tool option in profile settings.

After doing this, we will delete the example models which are created by default in the Models folder by snowflake. 
We will then create a new folder named Staging, this will be our staging environment. 

After doing this, we will write a SQL script in it and then write dbt run from inside our netflixproject folder to ensure everything is set
correctly.
